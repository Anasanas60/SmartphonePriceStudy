# SmartphonePriceStudy
A machine learning project to predict smartphone prices in the Bangladeshi market using Linear Regression. This project covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
# Smartphone Price Study for the Bangladeshi Market

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the price of smartphones based on their specifications. The project uses a dataset of phones available in the Bangladeshi market and applies a Linear Regression model to find the relationship between features and price.

## üìã Project Workflow

This project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
1.  **Data Collection:** The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains information on 3,338 smartphone models.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** This was the most critical phase.
    - Handled missing values.
    - Cleaned and converted columns like `Price`, `RAM`, and `Battery Capacity` from text to numerical types.
    - Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features like `Brand` and `OS` to make them usable by the model.
3.  **Model Training:** A **Linear Regression** model was trained on the cleaned dataset.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was assessed using standard regression metrics.

## üìä Results & Evaluation

The trained model was evaluated on a held-out test set.

*   **R-squared (R¬≤):** 0.61
    *   *This indicates that the model is able to explain approximately 61% of the variance in smartphone prices based on the provided features.*
*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 12,705.10 BDT
    *   *This means that, on average, the model's price predictions are off by about 12,705 Taka.*

**Conclusion:** The model shows a good ability to understand the general trends in the market (a respectable R¬≤ score), but there is room for improvement in the precision of its individual price predictions.
